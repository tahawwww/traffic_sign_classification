# Traffic Sign Recognition

## Overview

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize traffic signs from images. The model is built with TensorFlow and provides an interactive user interface using Gradio. You can upload an image of a traffic sign and get its classification result.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images of traffic signs into predefined classes.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface through Gradio to upload images and view predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow 2.17.0
- Gradio

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git
cd traffic-sign-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
